Apple steps
===================================
Remove iosMain, iosTest sourcesets.  Empty anyway
add macX64 main and test sourcesets
create nativeInterop/cinterop, copy .def file from SqlCipher intellij project. All targets should use
    same def file
add iosArm64, iosX64, macosX64 targets all as static libraries
add cinterop clause to macosx64
change sqlcipher gradle config to build apple targets, point cinterop clause
    at includes and static libs from builds by platform
commit changes.
Copy project to apple
sync, run cinterop for at least MacOs
use native code from old SqlCipher, populate macOs actual class SqlCipherApi.kt with native code
make a macOS unit test, see the basic tests class for the required functional tests
Verify/debug until tests pass for macOS
populate cinterop and SqlCipherApi.kt of iosX64Main, make sure all builds
work through Apple Framework support to make a static library Framework callable from swift
make an Xcode text project, have a simple swift program do open database and basic tests
run on simulator to see if all works.
